<h1>FRANK AND FRAN'S HATTERAS ISLAND FISHING REPORT - 10/12/2025</h1><div class="post-content"><p><br>Well, it has not been a great weather day. But some brave people went out today, and some were successful! Shaun caught a nice drum late this morning. You can't catch them on the couch! Way to go, Shaun! <br><br>Unfortunately, today's midday high tide did some damage. A large stretch of the dunes at the canal zone (in between Pea Island visitor center and the bridge) has been washed away since about 11:30 this morning. The crews got out there and did some work on it after high tide, but the waves are just knocking down what they've done. NCDOT 12 posted that they would be back at it in the morning. <br><br>Buxton is looking okay right now, but still some standing water in the road. Remember, it is salt water, meaning it is not good for your vehicles or others!  We are hoping for the best with the damage done to the road at Pea Island. Hopefully, the ocean doesn't beat on it too much tonight! <br><br>We have some fresh mullet left, along with plenty of other bait options. We also have plenty of cigars if you just want to relax at the house during this nasty weather. Or... come stock up on rig-building supplies and get ready! <br><br>#fishingreport #hookedonfandf</p></div><img src="https://scontent-fra3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/559413863_1248806200612684_8549298431478655633_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=MeN3rkhjwOMQ7kNvwEEb9GB&_nc_oc=AdmHObSq5-NKKkrKcqClHEvysbAMQ9fi48M7EjUjJ59d08s_Vlw5Ps6aBMhMPVV_-mk&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-fra3-2.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=OEJOW6gcz0P9T095kLOS8w&oh=00_AffT53He5gH5MHiNFQY4_W30jN4ExsSnB9o-5evosfAFFQ&oe=68F29746" alt="Fishing image"><img src="https://scontent-fra5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/559013564_1248806170612687_4573333738068147452_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=vN43HJD8LEQQ7kNvwHLYRbz&_nc_oc=AdkmJ-an8VvXko_5lDk7fgl3eNuHIhVME1CjmMNff-LMzqZvOQFzHMMT2d_qWMXydQU&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-fra5-2.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=OEJOW6gcz0P9T095kLOS8w&oh=00_AffnoHYX_y3uX4JzN-L9NY5WSU_99bpt8oaCCMoQM4iN3g&oe=68F2676C" alt="Fishing image"><img src="https://scontent-fra5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/559455857_1248808980612406_6905458429405472227_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=KYP8CXGFDCEQ7kNvwGBXhEA&_nc_oc=Adk-HdW5Wzwb4TieeY-qoe421HwpN63aIoLV7xZycjrknn7Z7-Q9Fd_8HFh3wEVn6Zw&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-fra5-1.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=OEJOW6gcz0P9T095kLOS8w&oh=00_Afdu8k6jvLBS4wL0d2LiuLwocGlZ2lQHAlZslBedt4SPgw&oe=68F29871" alt="Fishing image"><img src="https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/559485225_1248806173946020_8683864546447637368_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=V4sj011tol8Q7kNvwEWjwfs&_nc_oc=AdmL69BEMI2euM9d-Rm_DmWnLVPERgTQbNAnRnckfKN_BUNvl2cNZq6fWjKryWUrkCs&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-fra3-1.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=OEJOW6gcz0P9T095kLOS8w&oh=00_Afd7JHGsxoS0JjhOoXya8_54c7nXjRzx_u1qhQNGgQ7WKQ&oe=68F2781F" alt="Fishing image">
