<h1>FRANK AND FRAN'S HATTERAS ISLAND FISHING REPORT 12/15/2025</h1><div class="post-content"><p><br>Brrrrr, it was cold out today! Not as cold as many of you have it up north, but cold enough for here. Unfortunately, there isn't much to report today, as we haven't heard of anyone going out. However, we were busy in the shop placing 2026 orders! We are working hard to keep the shop stocked with the same products everyone has come to know and love, but also bring in some new ones! <br><br>Of course, it will be a while before these new products arrive, but we are excited for y'all to see! As of now, we still have a good selection of products to get you through until spring. Come and stock up with rigs, or rig-making supplies if you make them yourself, so you're ready when the bite turns on this spring! <br><br>Shop now at https://hatteras-island.com/<br><br>#fishingreport #hookedonfandf</p></div><img src="https://scontent-ams2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/598934866_1301677415325562_3998971049745365482_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_s960x960_tt6&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=vGUQ2zEAHX4Q7kNvwE6caE8&_nc_oc=AdnmZjl30CjPKGZG8zljyNZ6xcvdOcwJNmF8ujtm3h1CUIxuWoUWXNPlp3KnI4YkvrA&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-ams2-1.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=zX24jbp9ogaidf7eESM2Qw&_nc_tpa=Q5bMBQHqtF9gHAtGFn966inrft_2ijFEcdxHWwpv0X8P7J23swR55G6AWe-rCtSG2Ptz9UsrlHcfeBw-Ow&oh=00_AfnK-Z5K5CdMM0VUbQclnWSW6CrAb8eWQp3mwfalE2iIHA&oe=6946A460" alt="Fishing image">
