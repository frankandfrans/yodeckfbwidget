<h1>ðŸš¨NEWS RELEASEðŸš¨</h1><div class="post-content"><p>Consistent with Dare and Hyde Counties issuance of a State of Emergency and mandatory evacuations of Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands, Cape Hatteras National Seashore will be closing beach accesses and facilities.  Coastal flooding and ocean over wash are expected to begin as early as Tuesday, August 19, 2025 and continue through Thursday, August 21, 2025. Portions of N.C. Highway 12 on Hatteras Island will likely be impassable for several days. <br><br>The Coastal Flood Watch indicates that extreme beach erosion and coastal damage is likely along the oceanside, resulting in a significant threat to life and property. Large, dangerous waves will likely inundate and destroy protective dune structures. Severe flooding will likely extend inland where there is vulnerable or no protective dune structure, flooding homes and businesses with some structural damage possible. Roads will likely be impassable.  <br>The High Surf Advisory indicates large breaking waves of 15-20-plus feet should be expected in the surf zone. Life-threatening swimming and surfing conditions are expected, as well as wave action resulting in significant beach erosion.<br><br>Visitors should stay off the beaches completely and discontinue use of all beach trails and boardwalks beginning Tuesday morning. <br><br>The following closures will be in effect in preparation of the storm.<br>Visitor Facilities:  The Museum of the Sea at Cape Hatteras Lighthouse and the Discovery Center on Ocracoke Island will be closed by 5:00 PM today, August 18th.  Facilities will not reopen until the storm has passed and assessments are made to determine a safe opening. <br>Bodie Island Lighthouse will be closing on Wednesday and Thursday.<br><br>Campgrounds:<br>Cape Point, Frisco, and Ocracoke campgrounds will close today, August 18th, by 3:00 PM.  Oregon Inlet Campground will close at noon on Tuesday, August 19th. <br><br>Beaches and Off-Road Vehicle Access:<br>Off-road vehicle (ORV) ramps will be closed by 9:00 on August  18th for the safety of ORV permittees before, during, and after the impacts from Hurricane Erin.
