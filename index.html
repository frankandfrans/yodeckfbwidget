<h1>FRANK & FRAN'S HATTERAS ISLAND FISHING REPORT 8/1/25</h1><div class="post-content"><p><br>Happy beginning of August! It's been a good day for fishing, with reports of croaker and sea mullet scattered about the oceanside, along with some blues, and here in Avon, some pretty nice pompano! There are reports of a few puppy drum and speckled trout on the soundside. The Casey and Powell families from Norfolk and Virginia Beach caught numerous pompano on Ramp 38 today, including one that was a citation. Sand fleas have been the bait of choice for pompano. We carry frozen sand fleas in shop, and also sand flea rakes to catch your own! We have lots of sand flea rakes in stock in several price ranges. Shop with us in store, open daily from 6am-9pm, or online at https://hatteras-island.com/search.php?search_query=sand+flea+rake.<br>ðŸš¨We also restocked on Korker's today!
