<h1>FRANK & FRAN'S HATTERAS ISLAND FISHING REPORT 11/22/25</h1><div class="post-content"><p><br>The drum were here this morning! There were reports of a great drum bite this morning at the point, and reports of lots of sea mullet up and down the island, as well as some spot. Creech caught this nice drum this morning during the bite! Great catch! Thank you for sharing!<br> Drum are hitting on fresh mullet, and some folks are using fresh spot they're catching.  Sea mullet (and spot) are still biting primarily on Fishbites, from what we are hearing - specifically sand flea, shrimp, and bloodworm Fishbites on sand flea imitation rigs or just bare rigs. We have fresh mullet for the drum, and fresh shrimp and many varieties of Fishbites. We also have frozen tuna belly, peeler crabs, squid, sand fleas and several other kinds of bait. Come check out our selection in store, open daily from 6am-7pm, and don't forget to follow us online to keep up with the fishing report at www.hatteras-island.com<br>#fishingreport #hookedonfandf</p></div><img src="https://scontent-ord5-3.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/585572374_1284227943737176_4967513868076291539_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s960x960_tt6&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=lejN7OcxVy8Q7kNvwEccAI6&_nc_oc=AdlQIxvy5U7u-oKKTKhmO8Mp2kvcEDl69nYUhEfRfJM3H63zXsF5czfzFKBN9M1s6NE&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-3.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=mcJoJ1IE2VjiZJ2Urz4YYw&_nc_tpa=Q5bMBQHDujow92426cIExmuZ64X0TUCX2dhQ1ax8WUxjUeqOqQq6pTd5NCuWg05LXujrl2hJAK7sxJeZdg&oh=00_AfgcZ4bN8BCVQ7zuZ1yk8J6M9X_65Eqqv7m_6gIr8IhDBQ&oe=6928177E" alt="Fishing image">
