<h1>FRANK & FRAN'S HATTERAS ISLAND FISHING REPORT 10/2/25</h1><div class="post-content"><p><br>Despite the wind and more overwash down in Buxton, it turned out to be a cool, gorgeous day! From the surfside, we didn't have many reports, just a couple of puppy drum in South Buxton. Soundside here in Avon, we heard of nice-sized bluefish and some puppy drum this morning, along with some larger drum last night. When fishing the sound side, if you want to cast out and enjoy sitting for a bit, a double drop bottom rig with some mullet is perfect! If you'd rather be actively jigging, try a popping cork jig! Cast out, and as you're reeling, give it a good tug now and then to bring the fish in! We have all these rigs and more that are pre-tied for your convenience; or you can build your own! We have all the materials to do so in stock! Come on in and grab what you need. We are open daily from 6am-9pm, or you can shop online at www.hatteras-island.com<br>https://hatteras-island.com/rigs-beads/<br>#fishingreport #hookedonfandf</p></div><img src="https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/557746399_1239264434900194_6168865955824519823_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720_tt6&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=lLtg9LmbS2EQ7kNvwHiQdCG&_nc_oc=Adn9X_ZDG_JcNusLxg5pOE-y3kORKOPTz6Yr3mFy2YeKnvMbwh4RsBJaZuAXvd-xQmw&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=r0IFNAd-x8GS8Mp1C_4Ccg&oh=00_AffbfHF1q5b5Xuz3fickEZohq4zht4WZFgj3VEoNyS-Ebg&oe=68E56F6C" alt="Fishing image">
