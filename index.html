<h1>FRANK AND FRAN'S HATTERAS ISLAND FISHING REPORT - 9/30/2025</h1><div class="post-content"><p><br>While it was not the nicest of days out today, Capt Joey on Fingeance Sportfishing got out there and caught some blues and drum. We did hear of a few going out today, but the only reports we had from shore were some pinfish from the soundside. Unfortunately, it's going to be a bit windier tomorrow, which is one thing Buxton does not need. <br><br>We received a big order of cigars today. Come grab one (or a handful ðŸ˜‰) and relax tomorrow while this nasty weather passes. <br><br>Drive slowly through any standing water on the roads, as it is saltwater! Not good for your vehicle or others ðŸ™‚<br><br>#fishingreport #hookedonfandf</p></div><img src="https://scontent-atl3-3.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/556803979_1237499488410022_5822222344790291156_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s720x720_tt6&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=-g7YrDWaw0MQ7kNvwGa2psM&_nc_oc=AdkSosRi_GRP0WcYKfLZ9RLrdZBhI4GVSb1quXJz6ssEJ9SviW-AxkgOmU6rmHqzPCs&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-3.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=sCqc0i4c1PEPRk6YiA0ovg&oh=00_Afb-qnK9gLrCne6ZBjymEGVPhRMdn8jEZ2cOSkwYNywvtQ&oe=68E26687" alt="Fishing image">
