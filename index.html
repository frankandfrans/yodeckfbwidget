<h1>FRANK AND FRAN'S HATTERAS ISLAND FISHING REPORT - 10/14/2025</h1><div class="post-content"><p><br>Unfortunately, it was another gloomy day with spitting rain. Lots of people are coming in and getting bait, but we haven't had too many reports. Most are struggling to hold bottom as it is taking a good bit of weight. We did hear of a few sea mullet, blues, and puppy drum scattered up and down the beach. <br><br>The 200lbs of mullet we got this morning is ALMOST gone, but we are hoping to get another load tomorrow. We also have fresh bunker and a variety of other baits in stock. We are open until 9pm, come and see us. <br><br>#fishingreport #hookedonfandf</p></div><img src="https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/560506548_1250598517100119_7919645724927974100_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=QEQo_spmBgEQ7kNvwEKcHl7&_nc_oc=Adlc8q5c98zCMZYQLJ1zaERDIlkarq_R4gdljoJNDGSJAGYtCwcnfBARxfsZUMH5DF0&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=SEataFdx4UZ_uEfd6k8VOA&oh=00_AfdC27Nuv138yZN8-ry6FF-fV-VHn7LieMxKlmG3l6KPbQ&oe=68F5BF58" alt="Fishing image">
