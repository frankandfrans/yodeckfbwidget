<h1>FRANK & FRAN'S HATTERAS ISLAND FISHING REPORT 12/3/25</h1><div class="post-content"><p><br>Haven't heard too much today, just some sea mullet scattered up and down the beaches, once again! They're still biting on Fishbites: bloodworm and sand flea varieties are the best! We restocked on the sand flea AND the electric chicken shrimp today, so come get 'em while they last! We are open daily from 7am-5pm, and you can shop online with us at www.hatteras-island.com<br><br>Also, we want to give a shoutout to our newest employee! Everyone, meet Matt! Matt joined us a couple of months ago and is an amazing addition to our team! He's very personable and knowledgeable, and always willing to help you get what you need to catch fish! If you haven't met him already, stop in and say hi! <br><br>PS: We gave him a Christmas mug that says "Good luck finding better coworkers than us!" 🤣<br><br>#fishingreport #hookedonfandf</p></div><img src="https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/590806791_1292565302903440_7876081119958882972_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=0Cnyt0p_Fx4Q7kNvwFY55Wf&_nc_oc=AdkDm5II53qY2vmFdNc8HLEOyBitL3ko0A_B-9QW202gQiAeZYRgnRt3k5SJRpyfTPg&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=IGiyMItBkXNjbr1KxTSjQw&_nc_tpa=Q5bMBQEjUZWANePTcg-mzs6Vj7FQEekFUG6ae0nuyLErNPAe3wfEUjUXc_oIOEcKNYR3Lh0urgXzR8W4DA&oh=00_AfnFWMJPPRbykBFNwlfVmJ9cNNHcG7-qth3CCk2KTTaeBw&oe=69370019" alt="Fishing image">
