<h1>FRANK AND FRAN'S HATTERAS ISLAND FISHING REPORT - 9/16/2025</h1><div class="post-content"><p><br>The drum are biting and the Nick's Custom Rods are flying out of here! Here is Kurt with his new 1205 that he picked up this afternoon. His lovely wife, Ann, decided Christmas would be in September this year. Best of luck to you, Kurt! Keep an eye out for the next Nick's Custom Rod delivery, it'll be coming soon.ðŸ˜‰We have heard of some sea mullet, small hand-sized pompano, blues, and drum out there. Looks like the wind is going to die down a good bit tomorrow. <br><br>Capt Joey VanDyke and his crew got plenty of nice blues and a slot drum. Give him a shout at captjoeyvandyke@gmail.com to get a trip booked! <br><br>As you're traveling up and down the island, you will notice some water on the road. Remember that it is SALTWATER and is not good for your vehicle or others! Please be kind and cautious if you are driving through any water. Slow down and do not splash others :)<br><br>We are open 6am-9pm. Come get stocked up or shop around at www.hatteras-island.com<br><br>#fishingreport #hookedonfandf #ctsfishing #ctsrods #nickscustomrods #avonnc #bluefish #drum #reddrum</p></div><img src="https://scontent-iad3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/547983484_1225190836307554_7731048957750752430_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s720x720_tt6&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=Ajv0MRxzTVsQ7kNvwF14LNE&_nc_oc=AdleawP3J9buhoQHfXxTfYRPdH-YJ0fq_0j2Dyf9geommnHk51-9a6rV6feKNOyXt_c&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=ja1awmBct87ozj4BnCndXw&oh=00_Afbjpika5EqpuyC0yBxP08eeBCl1ab_7_oH17-L4xw9k1Q&oe=68D00BE5" alt="Fishing image"><img src="https://scontent-iad3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/549484889_1225190822974222_5585202373052457378_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s720x720_tt6&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=mu8Tz28N-bQQ7kNvwFPO5V_&_nc_oc=AdldYT8T_Iye7NwIL6ibBU58NcVyqQIpb4O8Gf0p6n_xN8lK_pE3cRwdWZ6ESUXPbro&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=ja1awmBct87ozj4BnCndXw&oh=00_Afb1yz4GN7nF6-zi2aqqLnSXyrAu9EO99lNGYrNEKQsSdw&oe=68D00C41" alt="Fishing image">
