<h1>FRANK AND FRAN'S HATTERAS ISLAND FISHING REPORT - 9/28/2025</h1><div class="post-content"><p><br>Congratulations to all of the winners for the 2025 Hatteras Surf Fishing Challenge! ðŸŽ£ðŸ”¥Lots of sea mullet and pompano (many under 1lb) were caught. A few puppy drum and many bluefish were weighed in as well. We also heard about a few black drum being caught, but all were undersized. <br><br>Fortunately, Tropical Storm Imelda is not supposed to make landfall along the coast! While a direct hit is not forecasted, high swells and an increase in rip currents will be coming this week. Take advantage of tomorrow and Tuesday morning before the surf gets rough! ðŸŒŠWe are stocked up on all baits, plenty of tackle, and anything else you might need! <br><br>Don't feel like fishing in the weather mid-week? Get stocked up on rig-tying supplies and get ready to get out there after it calms down. Or... grab some cigars and relax! We are here 6am-9pm daily.  <br><br>#fishingreport #hookedonfandf</p></div><img src="https://scontent-ams2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/556061761_1235616981931606_3014478114210848864_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=ZCzxxi9yRfkQ7kNvwGP_S65&_nc_oc=AdlT1XO76wXVPTDca753sZcui-5flQbLjGjfeSYy3HRlJRnhcyZa9bPMOB_qHgF84Ho&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-ams2-1.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=QHklP_J_QqIjpacDo6CT-Q&oh=00_AfZ_fuuLvLf2Vit-PZ3G6ozjCCNvlYpi_BUgZ4_HnhA_2Q&oe=68E01E43" alt="Fishing image"><img src="https://scontent-ams4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/555948442_1235616475264990_7031730220172818639_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=nCtXo_tjgd0Q7kNvwGJi9DS&_nc_oc=AdkAX-m77SQJHTkzgp-zozHfiD_7LDsGRq7a_mKgLl6kPGyouiBwlyPpki6A7ArYrss&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-ams4-1.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=QHklP_J_QqIjpacDo6CT-Q&oh=00_AfZ4B0reUIbcMGH_9E6NQKvQffr-F3ziFB-mxaKAlw_l5Q&oe=68E01878" alt="Fishing image">
