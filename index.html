<h1>FRANK AND FRAN'S HATTERAS ISLAND FISHING REPORT - 10/7/2025</h1><div class="post-content"><p><br>We have a couple more days before it gets nasty out there! Today was a nice day, although there was a lot of cloud cover. The Avon Pier did well again with drum this morning. We heard of a few pompano, spot, and sea mullet down at ramp 55. We also heard of a few puppy drum at ramp 38 and north of Avon on the soundside. Jane and Tom got into a pinfish blitz on the soundside today!  If you head that way, make sure to take plenty of mosquito repellent! <br><br>We are loaded up on fresh mullet, but it is going fast. Come and get it before it is gone! Open 6am-9pm daily. <br><br>#fishingreport #hookedonfandf</p></div><img src="https://scontent-lhr8-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/559556151_1243869761106328_3605901478847517550_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=b4XghXX5M_AQ7kNvwFy6z03&_nc_oc=AdkMbXlNBKfwsEuT6E-9pO4LwAcYGXRS8mb2SXQhTBiAIfJuUwQAhCYpsoIZlydWVhk&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-2.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=yw2JRGG7eWFjxKDp_tPjFQ&oh=00_AffNltK3esgyAceg-hbrNGR2yB-vnQ0ExHT-tlr4KGzhpA&oe=68EBD671" alt="Fishing image">
