<h1>FRANK AND FRAN'S HATTERAS ISLAND FISHING REPORT - 7/29/2025</h1><div class="post-content"><p><br>It was a hot one out there today with not much of a breeze! We heard of a few croaker out there today, but reports were slow. Morning and evenings have definitely been better for fishing since it is a little cooler. Captain Joey Vandyke on the Fingeance did well with blues and spanish today!  <br><br>We have a BRAND NEW apparel design coming soon! It has been delivered, and we will be unboxing it tomorrow morning. It will be on the website sometime tomorrow and will be available to purchase online at www.hatteras-island.com, or come check it out in-store. <br><br>Plenty of new stuff coming in daily, but an exciting one for today is the Team Daiwa 8' rod. This rod throws 1-4oz, making it a great lure rod, and it will even allow you to throw some lightweight and bait. It is super light in the hands, but made with quality materials, so not only are you getting a sensitive rod, but a durable one too. <br><br>We got another load of mullet in today and stocked up on our other baits as well. Come see us from 6am-9pm any day of the week! <br><br>#fishingreport #hookedonfandf #teamdaiwa #daiwa #apparel #hatterasisland #surfrod #spanishmackerel #bluefish</p></div><img src="https://scontent-atl3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/515437496_1184787163681255_2241154190041276086_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720_tt6&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=9FvhNp0QchwQ7kNvwHa3tUP&_nc_oc=AdlZztNatO-Ti_mgwUb6r1duv4tuQ4NSCYVtacJ-g0rG7IRZuJV_21oh7CP9-Jz78RQ&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=cLDaP8RjMAbsEM8bvZo2VQ&oh=00_AfSykt5jBw39VqlcmR4UnVoXGr3RunUKR2tna4t8ZPMh3g&oe=688FDECE" alt="Fishing image"><img src="https://scontent-atl3-3.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/524730571_1184790697014235_7242885523724812072_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s720x720_tt6&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=A0W1HC-G_aYQ7kNvwF_6ARn&_nc_oc=Adk0_8FVmZYU711tI-QnjE6hg6epwfpA24cfStyfkn9mqy1iiVz5Jg6LCMD-InpaOag&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-3.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=cLDaP8RjMAbsEM8bvZo2VQ&oh=00_AfSYWa_qyOuIk0d7GdXa-L9hV7YYRIax7hRmZdpIg8eJWg&oe=688FB2DB" alt="Fishing image">
