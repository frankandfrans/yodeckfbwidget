<h1>FRANK AND FRAN'S HATTERAS ISLAND FISHING REPORT - 8/18/2025</h1><div class="post-content"><p><br>Well... not much to report today with many people headed north! We did hear of a nice slot-size speckled trout behind Avon, around big island. Other than that, it has been a slow and quiet day on the island. <br><br>Unfortunately, overwash will cause a mess for 12, we are all hoping for the best and for everything to reopen asap. But for now, you can keep an eye on drivenc.gov using the road cameras if you are curious about the road conditions. NCDOT NC 12 is also a good page to see them. As always, we will post as soon as we hear updates about reopening. <br><br>With all that being said, we will be shortening our hours tomorrow: OPEN 6am-5pm . <br><br>#fishingreport #hookedonfandf #hurricaneerin</p></div><img src="https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/534809258_1201385245354780_6141552153427510427_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720_tt6&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=ZQq9vK_l9EsQ7kNvwFvG0YI&_nc_oc=AdlfWzZslI9Sft_0_X8ZEh_2nTfNsP7WuNwdXnffgjPzF76SM-39iH2SxYv4Fct6N5s&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&edm=AKIiGfEEAAAA&_nc_gid=1ypH3H2vsF3vLzrOWb0T6w&oh=00_AfU41x2WktNaSb2OUuDparoTq6do56zGyZp_CPJUy9_Gkg&oe=68A9A2BA" alt="Fishing image">
